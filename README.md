## Architecture

This app follows Clean Architecture principles:

lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/ # Common utils, themes, services
â”œâ”€â”€ features/ # Feature-specific modules
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ auth/ # Authentication logic
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ assessment/ # Assessment list & detail
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ appointment/ # Appointments
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/ # Shared widgets, models
â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart

**Layers:**

- `Data`: Firebase sources, DTOs, SharedPreferences
- `Domain`: Models, Repositories (abstract)
- `Presentation`: UI widgets, Riverpod state, Screens

---

## State Management

- **Riverpod** (v2+) for state management and dependency injection.
- All business logic separated from UI.

## ðŸ“² How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   by using thie - git clone https://github.com/Magesh-kanna/watchyourhealthcd
2. cd watchyourhealth
3. flutter pub get
4. Set up Firebase:

   Place them in android/app/ and ios/Runner/ respectively.
5. "flutter run" or "fvm flutter run" [If you are using FVM]

## Design

## Technical Decisions

1. Chose Riverpod for better modularity, testing, and DI.
2. Implemented Clean Architecture to separate concerns and improve testability.
3. Used Firestoreâ€™s cache mechanism with cacheSizeBytes.
4. Used flutter_hooks to simplify widget state where applicable.
5. Animations powered by Hero, AnimatedSwitcher, and PageRouteBuilder.

## Challenges

1. Handling Firestore pagination with offline caching.
